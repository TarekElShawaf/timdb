## _Important Note_

Please note that I developed the entire website in a single day as I am currently serving my last days in the military. Due to my circumstances, I could only dedicate a few hours on Friday to work on this project.

As a result, I sincerely apologize if the project feels rushed or lacks polish. I put my absolute best effort into the time I had available, and I hope you will take my situation into consideration. Thank you for understanding.

## Introduction

**TIMDB** is an online movies website that allows users to:

- Search for movies
- View detailed information about each movie
- Add movies to their list of favorites

## Challenges Faced

1. **Time Constraints**
   As explained above, my time was extremely limited, which made it challenging to deliver a fully polished project.

2. **Learning Zustand**
   I had to learn a new state management library, Zustand, and apply it within a very short timeframe. This added an extra layer of difficulty to the development process.

3. **Finding suitable movies API**
   It wasn't easy to find an open movies API that's actually good that's why I had to turn to the one I'm currently using where's it only returns one movie per time (please note that this is why I rendered a few static movies in the landing page as I had no way to fetch a number of movies without manually searching for them and adding them statically. I could've gone without them completely of course, but I decided to keep them for decorartive puproses )

## Solutions and Resources

To overcome most of the problems I encountered, I relied heavily on the documentation for Next.js and Zustand. These resources were incredibly illustrative and helpful in guiding me through the development process.

Again, I sincerely apologize if anything seemed rushed. Thank you for your understanding and consideration.
